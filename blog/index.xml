However, it supports querying and manipulating JSON data by providing a special data type called Variant. So, if we store the JSON documents in a single column table, Snowflake will effectively be querying JSON object.
For example, consider this table defenition:
CREATE TABLE JSON_DATA (DATA VARIANT); If the JSON documents are in an S3 bucket, we can import the data using a copy into command.</description></item><item><title>Automatic Data Ingestion in Snowflake Using Snowpipe</title><link>https://blog.vishnuvp.in:1313/blog/automatic-data-ingestion-in-snowflake-using-snowpipe/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2020 15:52:12 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://blog.vishnuvp.in:1313/blog/automatic-data-ingestion-in-snowflake-using-snowpipe/</guid><description>Snowflake is the new buzzword in the cloud world, which offers data-warehouse-as-a-service (probably DWAAS in the cloud lingo). If you would like to read more about its capabilities and use cases around it, take a look at their site here. FYI, they have built a new SQL Engine from scratch, and the whole platform runs on AWS infrastructure. It is a technological irony that Snowflake performs better (in my opinion) than Amazon Redshift in many ways.</description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://blog.vishnuvp.in:1313/blog/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 18:55:52 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://blog.vishnuvp.in:1313/blog/hello-world/</guid><description>Hello ¡Hola! नमस्ते Bonjour! Здравствуйте! நமஸ்காரம் ನಮಸ್ಕಾರ! നമസ്‌കാരം
I learned that inertia is temporary. So, I have moved away from blogger. This is my new abode for rare to occasional technical blabberings and travelogues. The old blog is still up at vishnuvenukumar.blogspot.com - all posts intact; in case someone finds one of the random troubleshooter posts useful.
I will try to move older posts here, probably during the next vacation.</description></item></channel></rss>
