However, it supports querying and manipulating JSON data by providing a special data type called Variant. So, if we store the JSON documents in a single column table, Snowflake will effectively be querying JSON object.
For example, consider this table defenition:
CREATE TABLE JSON_DATA (DATA VARIANT); If the JSON documents are in an S3 bucket, we can import the data using a copy into command.</description></item><item><title>Automatic Data Ingestion in Snowflake Using Snowpipe</title><link>/blog/automatic-data-ingestion-in-snowflake-using-snowpipe/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2020 15:52:12 +0530</pubDate><guid>/blog/automatic-data-ingestion-in-snowflake-using-snowpipe/</guid><description>Snowflake is the new buzzword in the cloud world, which offers data-warehouse-as-a-service (probably DWAAS in the cloud lingo). If you would like to read more about its capabilities and use cases around it, take a look at their site here.

It is a technological irony that Snowflake performs better (in my opinion) than Amazon Redshift in many ways.</description></item></channel></rss>
