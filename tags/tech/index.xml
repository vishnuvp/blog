This will not work in MacOS as Docker-Desktop-for-Mac networking is programmed different.
To make this scenario work, Docker Desktop for Mac provides a work around and it is pretty simple. The gateway is provided with an internal DNS name host.</description></item><item><title>Automatic Data Ingestion in Snowflake Using Snowpipe</title><link>/blog/automatic-data-ingestion-in-snowflake-using-snowpipe/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2020 15:52:12 +0530</pubDate><guid>/blog/automatic-data-ingestion-in-snowflake-using-snowpipe/</guid><description>Snowflake is the new buzzword in the cloud world, which offers data-warehouse-as-a-service (probably DWAAS in the cloud lingo). If you would like to read more about its capabilities and use cases around it, take a look at their site here. FYI, they have built a new SQL Engine from scratch, and the whole platform runs on AWS infrastructure. It is a technological irony that Snowflake performs better (in my opinion) than Amazon Redshift in many ways.</description></item></channel></rss>
